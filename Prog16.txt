//16. 16. Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the reverse of that string. For example, if the input is "hello," the output should be "olleh."

---------------------------------

In this code:

The user is prompted to enter a string.

The ReverseString method is called with the input string as an argument.

Inside the ReverseString method, the string is first converted to a character array using str.ToCharArray().

A while loop is used to reverse the character array. It starts with two pointers, left at the beginning and right at the end of the array. The characters at these positions are swapped in each iteration until left is no longer less than right.

After reversing the character array, it's converted back to a string using new string(charArray) to get the reversed string.

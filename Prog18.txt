//18. Write a program that checks if a given number is a perfect number.
(sum of all divisors excluding itself should be equal to that number e.g.; 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)



To determine if a given number is a perfect number, you can use a simple loop to find all divisors (excluding the number itself) and calculate their sum. If the sum is equal to the original number, it's a perfect number. Here's a beginner-friendly C# program using `int.Parse` to achieve this:

```csharp
using System;

namespace PerfectNumberChecker
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to check if it's a perfect number:");
            int number = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            int sumOfDivisors = 0;

            // Find and sum all divisors (excluding the number itself)
            for (int i = 1; i < number; i++)
            {
                if (number % i == 0)
                {
                    sumOfDivisors += i;
                }
            }

            if (sumOfDivisors == number)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is a perfect number.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is not a perfect number.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this program:

1. The user is prompted to enter a number.

2. The input is read and parsed as an integer using `int.Parse`.

3. A variable `sumOfDivisors` is initialized to zero to store the sum of divisors.

4. A `for` loop is used to iterate through numbers from 1 to `number - 1`. These are the potential divisors.

5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number is a divisor of the input number (`number % i == 0`). If it is, it adds it to the `sumOfDivisors`.

6. After the loop, it compares the `sumOfDivisors` with the original number. If they are equal, it's a perfect number; otherwise, it's not.

This program checks whether the input number is a perfect number and provides the result.

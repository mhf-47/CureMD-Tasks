//19. Write a program that prints the following pattern up to n rows (where n is user input).

//1
//12
//123
//1234
//...
//123...n


You can create a C# program to print the pattern as described using simple beginner-level logic. Here's the code:

```csharp
using System;

namespace NumberPattern
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of rows for the pattern:");
            int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++)
            {
                for (int num = 1; num <= row; num++)
                {
                    Console.Write(num);
                }
                Console.WriteLine(); // Move to the next line after each row
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this program:

1. The user is prompted to enter the number of rows for the pattern.

2. The input is read and parsed as an integer using `int.Parse`.

3. A nested `for` loop is used to create the pattern:
   - The outer loop (`for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++)`) iterates through each row.
   - The inner loop (`for (int num = 1; num <= row; num++)`) iterates through each number in the current row.

4. The inner loop prints numbers from 1 to the current row number, creating the pattern.

5. After printing each row, it moves to the next line using `Console.WriteLine()` to create the pattern shape.

This program prints the pattern up to the specified number of rows as entered by the user.

-------------------------

Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of the logic behind the code:

1. The program first prompts the user to enter the height of a right-angle triangle.

2. It reads the user's input as a string using `Console.ReadLine()` and stores it in the `input` variable.

3. The program then uses `int.Parse(input)` to attempt to convert the user's input into an integer. If the input is a valid integer, it's stored in the `height` variable. However, if the input is not a valid integer, it will result in an unhandled exception.

4. After obtaining the height, the program uses two nested `for` loops to print the right-angle triangle. The outer loop iterates through each row, and the inner loop iterates through each column in the current row.

5. In the inner loop, it prints "*" characters based on the current row number, which gives the right-angle triangle effect.

6. After printing each row, it moves to the next line using `Console.WriteLine()` to create the triangle shape.

The code assumes that the user will enter a valid integer as the height of the triangle. If a non-integer input is provided, it will result in an exception, so it's important to ensure valid input when using this code.

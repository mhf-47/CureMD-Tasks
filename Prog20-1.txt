Certainly, you can simplify the code by not using `int.Parse`, and we can keep the logic within the `Main` method for simplicity. Here's a revised version of the program with these changes:

```csharp
using System;

namespace LongestCommonSubsequence
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the first string:");
            string str1 = Console.ReadLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the second string:");
            string str2 = Console.ReadLine();

            int m = str1.Length;
            int n = str2.Length;

            int[,] dp = new int[m + 1, n + 1];

            // Build the DP table to find the length of LCS
            for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
                {
                    if (i == 0 || j == 0)
                        dp[i, j] = 0;
                    else if (str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1])
                        dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1;
                    else
                        dp[i, j] = Math.Max(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1]);
                }
            }

            // Build the longest common subsequence from the DP table
            int index = dp[m, n];
            char[] lcs = new char[index];

            int p = m, q = n;
            while (p > 0 && q > 0)
            {
                if (str1[p - 1] == str2[q - 1])
                {
                    lcs[index - 1] = str1[p - 1];
                    p--;
                    q--;
                    index--;
                }
                else if (dp[p - 1, q] > dp[p, q - 1])
                    p--;
                else
                    q--;
            }

            string longestCommonSubsequence = new string(lcs);

            Console.WriteLine("Longest Common Subsequence: " + longestCommonSubsequence);
        }
    }
}
```

In this simplified version:

1. The user is prompted to enter two strings.

2. The input strings are directly used without parsing as integers.

3. The program calculates the longest common subsequence using dynamic programming.

4. The longest common subsequence is displayed to the user.

This version doesn't use `int.Parse`, making it easier to understand.


The line `int[,] dp = new int[m + 1, n + 1];` declares a two-dimensional array `dp` that is used to store the results of subproblems when solving the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. Here's an explanation of this line:

- `int[,] dp`: This declares an array named `dp` that can store integers. It's a two-dimensional array, which is often used in dynamic programming to store solutions to subproblems efficiently.

- `m + 1` and `n + 1`: The array is created with dimensions `(m + 1)` rows and `(n + 1)` columns. These dimensions are derived from the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`. By using `(m + 1)` and `(n + 1)` instead of just `m` and `n`, you allow for additional row and column to store base cases (i.e., when one of the strings is empty).

In dynamic programming, the two-dimensional array `dp` is filled with values during the process of solving the LCS problem. Each cell in the array represents the solution to a subproblem, with the final value in `dp[m, n]` representing the length of the longest common subsequence.

By using a two-dimensional array, the program efficiently stores and retrieves solutions to overlapping subproblems, which is a key concept in dynamic programming. This allows for a more optimized approach to solving problems like finding the LCS.
